## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ PRINTING NUMBERS FROM M TO N

###  Aim
To write a Python program that prints all numbers from M to N, including both M and N.

---

###  Algorithm

1.Start

2.Input the starting number M (denoted as a)

3.Input the ending number N (denoted as b)

4.Use a for loop to iterate from a to b (inclusive)

5.Print each number in the loop

6.End

---

### ðŸ§¾ Program

```
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

for i in range(a,b+1):
    print(i)

```
### OUTPUT
