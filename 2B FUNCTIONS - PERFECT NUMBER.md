## FUNCTIONS - PROGRAM TO PERFORM SUM, SUBTRACTION AND MULTIPLICATION USING FUNCTION

### AIM  
To write a Python program that defines a function called result which accepts two numbers as arguments and returns their sum, difference, and product.

---

### ALGORITHM

1.Start

2.Define a function result(a, b)

3.Inside the function:

4.Calculate the sum of a and b

5.Calculate the difference (a - b)

6.Calculate the product (a * b)

7.Return or print all three results in a formatted way

8.Accept two integer inputs from the user

9.Call the result() function with the input values

10.End

---

### PROGRAM
```
def result(a,b):
    print("Sum is {},Sub is {},&Multiply is {}".format(a+b,a-b,a*b))
a=int(input())
b=int(input())

```
