## SEB - PYTHON PROGRAM TO MULTIPLY THREE NUMBERS USING FUNCTION

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program that defines a function which takes three arguments and returns the multiplication of the three numbers.

---

### ALGORITHM

1.Start

2.Define a function using lambda or def that takes three arguments a, b, and c

3.Inside the function, multiply the three numbers: a * b * c

4.Assign the function to a variable named f

5.Take three integer inputs from the user

6.Call the function f(a, b, c) and print the result

7.End



---

### PROGRAM

```
def mul(a,b,c):
    f=a*b*c
    return f
    
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
print(mul(a,b,c))

```
